# Hotel-Rooms-Calendar-Management
This application has been the final assignment for the Cisco Python Course.
It's purpose is to help hotels have a better management of the availability of each room, on a span of three months: june, july and august. Basically, when the demand is high and hotel managers have to make sure the hotel has enough available room for its clients, the Python application comes in handy.
As for the languages and frameworks, it has been coded in Python, using the TKinter framework and SQLite3 library.
